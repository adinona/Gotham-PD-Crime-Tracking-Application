GCPD Tracker System 
===
This is my final version of the Gotham City Police Department Tracker System. 

Populating the dev database
---
You can populate the development database with a decent number of fictitious records with the command `rake db:populate`.  There are over 50 investigations generated, but only one is initially closed.

There is also a large set of criminals generated this time around, including many from Batman's famous 'Rogues Gallery'. Great reading and worth formatting appropriately.


Notes on tests
---
There is 100% test coverage for existing models and helpers.
